# Aramethic operator ***********************

print(x/y)# it gives accurate in float
print(x//y)# it gives integer value
print(x*y)
print(x**y) # it gives x power y
print(x%y)
print(x*y)
# presidence of operation starting from ** * / + - and we can give priority also by ()

print(round(z))
print(abs(-z))

# comparesion operator ***********************

a=(3>4) # simply it print False Boolean function
print(a)

print(7<9) # simply print True

print(7<=7) # simply print True

print(7!=7) # simply print True

# logical operator ***************************
